## Data Sources and Early Data Collection

Initial testing of the PsychExtract prototype utilised handwritten and scanned text samples derived from informal, volunteer-provided material. These samples were intentionally varied in format, handwriting style, and content length to explore the feasibility of optical character recognition (OCR) as a foundational component of the system.

Several early samples consisted of **long-form text**, including multi-page reflective or narrative-style writing. These were selected to approximate realistic use cases where users may work with extended notes or written reflections.

However, this approach introduced substantial variability and complexity at an early prototyping stage, making it difficult to isolate whether OCR performance issues stemmed from:

- handwriting variability,
- image quality,
- text density and length, or
- model limitations.

## Observed Limitations in Early OCR Evaluation

During initial experimentation, the OCR prototype demonstrated reduced reliability when applied to longer handwritten documents. Errors accumulated across pages, and transcription quality became increasingly difficult to assess consistently.

This revealed two key limitations:

1. **Evaluation ambiguity**: Long documents made it harder to determine whether recognition errors were systemic or incidental.
2. **Prototype overreach**: Testing extended texts exceeded the scope appropriate for an early-stage proof-of-concept.

These observations indicated that the prototype was being evaluated under conditions that were too complex for its current level of maturity.

## Data Synthesis and Refinement Strategy

In response, the data preparation strategy was refined to better support controlled evaluation.

Rather than relying on long-form handwritten documents, future OCR testing will focus on **shorter, synthesised text samples**. These samples will:

- consist of brief paragraphs or excerpts,
- represent emotionally relevant language aligned with the system’s goals,
- allow clearer comparison between input text and OCR output.

This shift enables more precise assessment of transcription accuracy while maintaining relevance to the intended application domain.

Importantly, this refinement does not reduce realism but instead reflects an **iterative prototyping approach**, where system components are validated incrementally before being applied to more complex data.

## Rationale for Using Shorter Text Samples

Using shorter text segments offers several advantages at this stage of development:

- clearer identification of OCR strengths and failure modes,
- improved comparability across samples,
- reduced noise during evaluation,
- better alignment with early user requirement findings, which emphasised usability and clarity.

This approach allows the OCR component to be evaluated in isolation before reintegration into longer pipelines involving emotion analysis and theme extraction.

## Forward-Looking Data Preparation Plan

Going forward, OCR evaluation will proceed using:

- synthesised handwritten samples created from concise text passages,
- controlled variation in handwriting style and layout,
- systematic comparison between ground truth text and OCR output.

Once baseline performance is established on shorter inputs, the system may later be re-tested on longer documents as part of future work.
